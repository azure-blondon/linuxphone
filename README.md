# hi!

Welcome to my journey of making a linux phone-like device.


## Goals

Smartphones are very proprietary, on hardware and software level. My objective is to make a device with similar capabilities, but that relies on free and open source resources as much as possible.

It will basically be a tiny computer with some i/o that will have a mobile-like ui.


### Hardware

> For a detailed description of hardware, see [hardware.md](hardware.md)

I'll be using a Raspberry pi 4 model B along with a 5 inch touchscreen monitor, a 10,000 mAh battery. 

The case will be modeled and 3d printed.


### Software

> For a detailed description of software, see [software.md](software.md)

The pi will run Arch linux with Sway as its window manager

## The Journey

Here is [the document where I write what I do](the_journey.md)

## Notes

This repo is not a comprehensive guide on how to setup a device from scratch.

It will help me document most of what I do to debug, and it might help people who want to do the same thing.
